#: Diffing {{{

# syntax_aliases pyj:py pyi:py recipe:py

#: File extension aliases for syntax highlight. For example, to syntax
#: highlight file.xyz as file.abc use a setting of xyz:abc. Multiple
#: aliases must be separated by spaces.

# num_context_lines 3

#: The number of lines of context to show around each change.

# diff_cmd auto

#: The diff command to use. Must contain the placeholder _CONTEXT_
#: which will be replaced by the number of lines of context. A few
#: special values are allowed: auto will automatically pick an
#: available diff implementation. builtin will use the anchored diff
#: algorithm from the Go standard library. git will use the git
#: command to do the diffing. diff will use the diff command to do the
#: diffing.

# replace_tab_by \x20\x20\x20\x20

#: The string to replace tabs with. Default is to use four spaces.

# ignore_name

#: A glob pattern that is matched against only the filename of files
#: and directories. Matching files and directories are ignored when
#: scanning the filesystem to look for files to diff. Can be specified
#: multiple times to use multiple patterns. For example::

#:     ignore_name .git
#:     ignore_name *~
#:     ignore_name *.pyc

#: }}}

#: Colors {{{

color_scheme dark

#: Whether to use the light or dark colors. The default of auto means
#: to follow the parent terminal color scheme. Note that the actual
#: colors used for dark schemes are set by the dark_* settings below
#: and the non-prefixed settings are used for light colors.

pygments_style catppuccin-latte

#: The pygments color scheme to use for syntax highlighting. See
#: pygments builtin styles <https://pygments.org/styles/> for a list
#: of schemes. Note that this **does not** change the colors used for
#: diffing, only the colors used for syntax highlighting. To change
#: the general colors use the settings below. This sets the colors
#: used for light color schemes, use dark_pygments_style to change the
#: colors for dark color schemes.

dark_pygments_style catppuccin-mocha

#: The pygments color scheme to use for syntax highlighting with dark
#: colors. See pygments builtin styles <https://pygments.org/styles/>
#: for a list of schemes. Note that this **does not** change the
#: colors used for diffing, only the colors used for syntax
#: highlighting. To change the general colors use the settings below.
#: This sets the colors used for dark color schemes, use
#: pygments_style to change the colors for light color schemes.
